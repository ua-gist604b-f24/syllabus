## Course Description
In this course you will learn about the open source software paradigm including how open source software is developed, released, and maintained. You will be introduced to three core open source GIS software technologies: QGIS, PostGIS, Geoserver, Leaflet, gdal, and more.

## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
You will understand the Open Source software development philosophy and have basic knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
You will be comfortable checking out projects from a Git repo, creating branches, reviewing changes, and issuing merge requests.
You will know and have experience using the primary OGC Standard protocols for serving and consuming vector and raster data: WMS and WFS.
You will be comfortable using QGIS for loading, symbolizing, and processing data from files, spatial databases, and OGC services.
You will be able to perform table joins and spatial joins in QGIS to combine spatial and tabular data.
You will be able to write a simple query or function using PyQGIS.
You will be comfortable performing basic administration of geoserver, including connecting data stores, creating/deleting layers, setting rendering styles on layers, creating layer groups, and using the WMS/WFS examples to generate example OGC queries.
You will be able to visualize data stored in PostGIS, geoserver, and shapefiles 
You will have foundational knowledge and experience using PostGIS.
You will be able to write basic PostGIS queries with the assistance of postgis.net and other docs.
You will be familiar with docker and containerization concepts.
You will understand core client-server architecture concepts and understand which GIS components belong to which class.
You will be able to create a webpage containing interactive GIS maps that allow you to add/edit/remove data, switch data sources, and a variety of web mapping tasks.
You will understand how web map tiling works.

## Participation
Interactive participation through Zoom is encouraged but not graded. You will get more out of the class and your career by engaging your colleagues. 

As it is a course about Open Source, we will emphasize the open source tools or practices where possible. Course content will be delivered through GitHub some course content will be available through d2l.

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a cloud-based code repository and collaborative development suite. You will need to create
an account if you do not already have one. Separately, an invitation will be sent to your U of A email address that will
grant you access to a GitHub Organization for this class.

## Required Text:

University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available at:
https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system 
Requests for incompletes (I) and withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with university
policies which are available at https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete and

## Assignments 
Assignments are assigned and available through the class schedule: [schedule.md](schedule.md). Assignments are assigned daily and are due within one week of being assigned. Late work is not accepted. As this class is immersive into new technologies, grading emphasis is on completion first, and then on thoroughness and effort. Incomplete assignments are eligible to receive full credit when technological or other circumstances arise if the student has diligently worked through reasonable avenues. As this is a technology course, emphasis is on problem solving when things don't go according to plan.

## Late Work Policy
As a rule, work will not be accepted late except in case of documented emergency or illness. You may petition the professor in writing for an exception if you feel you have a compelling reason for turning work in late. 

## Attendance Policy
Participation is required for all online course modules. Your participation is crucial to your
success and the success of others in your cohort. Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of
Students (or Dean’s designee) will be honored with advanced notice to the instructors. All
holidays or special events observed by organized religions will be honored for those students
who show affiliation with that particular religion. Notify your instructor(s) prior to your absence.
